backbone-tastypie modelgenerator 

This library enables the automatic creation of Models and Collections in the typical backbone-tastypie flavor with the usage of the schema metadata available for each resource. 
This enables the simple creation of web interfaces on data-centric RESTful applications.

Usage: 

Backbone.LoadModelsFromUrl("/api/v1/");

From this moment on every resource defined inthe model is available as a windows.* element.
